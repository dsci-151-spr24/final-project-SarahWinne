Lexical Richness Over The 17th-20th Centuries
================
by Sarah Winne

## Summary

A point to be highlighted before beginning, is that having high lexical
richness, or a wide variety of vocabulary, does not directly correlate
to a good quality book. In the same way, a smaller vocabulary, or less
lexical richness, does not automatically mean low quality writing. There
are many well written books with a simple vocabulary, as well as some
books with large vocabularies being a nightmare to suffer through.
Examples of good books on either side of the spectrum would be books
like “To Kill a Mockingbird” or “Of Mice and Men”, with simpler
vocabularies, while books like “Moby-Dick” and “Narrative of the Life of
Frederick Douglass” have much more extensive vocabularies. Looking at
the potential decline of lexical richness is not to say quality of
writing has decreased, simply the use of a wider vocabulary having
decreased.

The dataset used is from the Gutenberg Project, an online archive of
e-books. They are mainly older works that have expired copyrights in the
US, so it can be kept free. A few limitations of the dataset that come
from this would first be the lack of newer works. The dataset has less
books from the mid and late 1900’s than the beginning of the 1900’s.
There are also much fewer 17th-18th century works than 19th-20th century
works. However, the dataset from the Gutenberg Project is large enough
to ask the question of how lexical richness has changed over the past
few centuries.

Overall, there is a decreasing average lexical richness in the e-books
in the Gutenberg Project as they progress towards works published in the
20th century. Interestingly, this trend is not representative of the
works if the dataset is split in the middle.

Over the 17th-18th century books, which do have a much smaller sample
size, the change in lexical richness is very small throughout. However,
into the 19th century it begins dropping visibly as the sample size
increases. This trend continues into the 20th century collection.

Basically, the form of literature, whether the author was a parent, and
what decade or century they published in were the most helpful for
predicting lexical richness. Depending on the forms, lexical richness
went up a few hundread of varying amounts. If they had no children, it
was estimated to go down about 17.39, and for every increase in decade,
it went down by about 1.26. So while there aren’t incredibly significant
negative changes, over time lexical richness did go down. The decrease
is more apparent if you focus on the 19th-20th centuries, as during the
17th-18th lexical richness stays pretty constant. There is the fact that
the dataset from Project Gutenberg has fewer books from that time
period, as compared to the 19th-20th centuries.

While the average and median lexical richness do decrease more over the
19th-20th centuries, there is also a wider range of lexical richnesses
in both the positive and negative directions.

Write-up of your project and findings go here. Think of this as the text
of your presentation. Roughly 750 words. As long as you’re in the
ballpark of 750 words, you’re good! Ignore code chunks and only count
the words in prose. If using code, only one most important.
