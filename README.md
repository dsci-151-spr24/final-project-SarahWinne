Lexical Richness Over The 17-20th Centuries
================
by Sarah Winne

## Summary

A point to be highlighted before beginning, is that having high lexical
richness, or a wide variety of vocabulary, does not directly correlate
to a good quality book. In the same way, a smaller vocabulary, or less
lexical richness, does not automatically mean low quality writing. There
are many well written books with a simple vocabulary, as well as some
books with large vocabularies being a nightmare to suffer through.
Looking at the potential decline of lexical richness is not to say
quality of writing has decreased, simply the use of a wider vocabulary
having decreased.

Basically, the form of literature, whether the author was a parent, and
what decade or century they published in were the most helpful for
predicting lexical richness. Depending on the forms, lexical richness
went up a few hundread of varying amounts. If they had no children, it
was estimated to go down about 17.39, and for every increase in decade,
it went down by about 1.26. So while there aren’t incredibly significant
negative changes, over time lexical richness did go down. The decrease
is more apparent if you focus on the 19th-20th centuries, as during the
17th-18th lexical richness stays pretty constant. There is the fact that
the dataset from Project Gutenberg has fewer books from that time
period, as compared to the 19th-20th centuries.

While the average and median lexical richness do decrease more over the
19th-20th centuries, there is also a wider range of lexical richnesses
in both the positive and negative directions.

Write-up of your project and findings go here. Think of this as the text
of your presentation. Roughly 750 words. As long as you’re in the
ballpark of 750 words, you’re good! Ignore code chunks and only count
the words in prose. If using code, only one most important.
